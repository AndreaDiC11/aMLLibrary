# Documentation for configuration files
A configuration file is a text file containing all needed information to run `a-MLLibrary`.
All files in this folder conventionally use the `.ini` extension, but in principle they can be of any type of plain text file.
The content of a configuration file looks something like this:
```
[SectionName1]
option1 = value1
option2 = value2

[SectionName2]
option3 = value3  # This is a comment, it will be ignored in the parsing of the file
```

## List of options
